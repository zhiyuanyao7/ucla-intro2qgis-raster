## QGIS Layout

**a.**	The main area of QGIS is called the canvas. There are also panels and toolbars, a status bar and menu panels.   
**b.**	Panels and toolbars may be moved around and docked at different locations (left-click and hold to initiate this flexibility).  If you drop a panel on top of another, they will be nested into tabs. Panels you do not used can be removed. Toolbars can be moved around in much the same way, but you cannot nest toolbars into tabs. By right-clicking in the toolbar area, you may get a list of available panels and toolbars you can turn them on and off as you like.
**c.**	Through the menu, you can access almost everything in QGIS; some functions have buttons, and keyboard shortcuts as well.
**d.**	The status bar shows relevant information about the current tool or aspects of the map canvas, like coordinates and scale.
**e.**	Toolbox is where you can search for all the tools provided in QGIS. If you can see the toolbox as the figure shows, you can open it in the menu (Processing->Toolbox)

![QGIS layout](../fig/fig4-qgis-layout.png)

Use the map navigation toolbar to help navigate your map in the canvas. Here you can find tools to pan and zoom the map, zoom to selected features, and view the complete extent of the map or selected layer. You can also jump to a previous extent with dedicated buttons.

## Add raster data

To get started, letâ€™s add raster data that we need to analyze in this workshop. 

**a.**	In the Menu, click Layer->Add Layer->Add Raster Layer. 

![Add raster layer from Menu](../fig/fig6-add-raster-layer-from-menu.png)

**b.**	Navigate to the data folder and select NLCD_2016_Land_Cover_L48_ca_sp.

## Add vector data


Different Projections [Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgistbok.ucgis.org%2Fbok-topics%2Fmap-projections&psig=AOvVaw2Cyb9hT3V7QTPVg7j3ttVL&ust=1593707844112000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCOials--rOoCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAW)

The Apartments layer we mapped into QGIS canvas are locations represented by X and Y Coordinates (latitude and longitude on the Earth surface). To analyze the layer, we need to project the Apartments layer from latitude and longitude (unit in degrees) to a "flat paper" using a suitable method. We will project the Apartments layer into **NAD83(2011)/California Zone 5**. 

**1.**   Go to Processing Toolbox and search for projection. If the Processing Toolbox does not show on the right panel of QGIS layout. Go to the Menu, Processing, and Click Toolbox. 

**2.**   Select Reproject Layer.

**3.** In the Reproject Layer
* (1) choose **Apartmets**
* (2) click the button to select projections
* (3) type in **6432** in the Filter
* (4) choose **NAD83(2011)/California zone 5**
* (5) Click OK 
* (6) After the configuration, Cilck run.

## Save the reprojected layer

**1.** Looking at the renamed layer: Apartments_sp, you can find there is a button (looks like a caterpillar). This button indicates the layer is a temporal layer and is not saved. To save this layer, click the "caterpillar" button, a Save Scratch Layer window pops up. 

![Save the scratch layer (a)](../fig/Figure23-Save-the-scratch-layer-a.png)

## Spatial Analysis 

To find out which places are suitable for the student, we set two criteria:

* **there are at least 2 grocery stores within 400 meters of the buffer centered at the Apartments.**
* **Price is less than $1300. According to a study, a distance of 0.25 miles is often used as an accepted in U.S. research studies. We set 400 meters as the walking distance to make buffers around apartments.**

The price is set arbitrarily. You can set different price thresholds to compare the different result.

To meet the criteria, we need to

[`a. make 400 meters distance buffers centered at apartment`](#creat-walking-distance-buffers)

[`b. count the number of grocery stores with the buffers`](#count-points-within-buffers)

[`c. join the buffer's attribute to apartments layer`](#join-attribute-layer)

[`d. select the targeted apartments by attributes`](#select-feature-class-by-attributes)

[`e. export the targeted apartents`](#Export-the-selected-feature-class)

[`f. invert selection/select the rest of apartments, and export the unselected`](#invert-selection)

[`g. deselect all`](#deselect-the-selected-feature-class)


## Create walking distance buffers

**1.**  Go to Menu bar and find MMQGIS (the plugin installed). Click Create Buffers.

![Create buffers](../fig/Figure30-Create buffers.png)

**2.**  In the Create Buffers window 
* (1) select Apartments_sp. This is the layer that we will center to create buffers.
* (2) Set the radius as 400
* (3) Unit is meters
* (4) Click the button to save the buffers.
* (5) Save as buffer.shp
* (6) Click OK.

## Map elements

Data frame, legend, north arrow, and scale are required elements of a map. Though title is not mandatory, it is recommended as it provides more information regarding the topic of the map. In the new print layout window, navigate to the left panel, and then click the buttons accordingly to add these map elements to the canvas. Net step is to change the properties of these elements and adjust the positions to a beautiful map.

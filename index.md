## Welcome to the QGIS workshop
QGIS Quantum Geographic Information Systems (QGIS) is a user-friendly open source Geographic Information System (GIS) licensed under the GNU General Public License. This workshop exhibits a small portion of the many spatial analysis techniques QGIS offers to familiarize you with some of the basics, and to illustrate the fundamentals of GIS. In this workshop for beginners, we will applies some basic spatial analysis and raster analysis tools to calculate the percentage of green space for each census tract in Los Angeles County and make a map to show the result.

## Pre Workshop Survey
To get a better backgroud of the participantes and prepare for the workshop, we would like to get some information from you.

> ## Getting Started
>
> This workshop is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use 
> their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient 
> workflow. To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download 
> the data and install everything before working through this lesson.This workshop assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. 
> To get started, please download and install [QGIS Version 3.14](https://qgis.org/en/site/).

> ## QGIS project: Housing hunting plan
>
> In this project, you will help a student find a suitable apartment according to several criteria.
>
> | Content | Description |
> | ---- | ------|
> | **Research question** |Where should one student live when he/she wants to find a place where is close to grocery store, the price is lower than $1300/month and within 20 min distance to UCLA by public transit?|
> |**Study area** | Los Angeles County|
> | **Introduction & Objectives** | This workshop applies some basic spatial analysis tools to find out the suitable apartments for students. The objectives of the workshops are being familiar with QGIS layout, being able to use basic spatial analysis tools (e.g. buffer), changing layers properties, and making maps.| 
> |**Methodology**|1. Import csv file with X and Y Coordinates as a layer<br> 2. Add vector layers <br> 3. Project the layer into a proper projection<br> 4. Create buffers<br>5. Join attribute tables<br>6. Changes layers properties <br> 7. Create a print layout and make maps|
> |**Expected results**| Maps are saved for review. For this:<br>1. Learn to save map projects, and create, export, and save map print layouts.<br> 2. Add item contents (i.e. maps, text box, legend, north arrow, and scale bars) to compose a print layout, and modify item properties.|
> |**Analysis & Discussion**|To find the suitable apartment for the students, we need to consider other factors, such as having a car or not, the definition of grocery stores, the network distance instead of Euclidean distance when creating buffers.|
> |**Conclusion**|Thank you for attending the workshop. After reviewing the map, where do you think the best place for a student and why?|

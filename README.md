# Introduction to QGIS - Raster Analysis

## Overview
This is a workshop regarding Introduction to QGIS. The workshop helps learns be familiar with the layout of QGIS, be able to do simple raster analysis in QGIS, and make and export maps. The tools/functions that are introduced in this workshop are:

* projection
* Create buffer
* Count points within buffers
* Join attribute tables by commom field
* Select features by attributes

This workshop introduces the functions to learners by conducting a House Hunting project. The project aims to help a colleage student find a suitable apartment, where the apartment is within 20 min buffer from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the rent is less than $1300/month, and has at least 2 grocery stores within 400m walking distance.

After selection, the project asks to make a map to show the student where the suitable apartments are. The final results of this project will be a map showing the selected apartments together with the surrounded grocery stores and a street base map.

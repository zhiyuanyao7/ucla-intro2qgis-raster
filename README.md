This workshop introduces the functions to learners by conducting a House Hunting project. The project aims to help a colleage student find a suitable apartment, where the apartment is within 20 min buffer from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the rent is less than $1300/month, and has at least 2 grocery stores within 400m walking distance.
